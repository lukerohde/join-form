<%= @subscription.person.first_name %> is attempting to join or renew their membership and partially matched an existing membership record.  Unfortunately we couldn't verify their identity, so we are allowing them to procede as though they are a new member.  

WARNING: This may prevent <%= @subscription.person.first_name %> from renewing or result in them being double charged.  You are being sent this message so you can make sure everything is okay.

The details they provided are as follows
<% @params.each do |k,v| %>
	<%= "    #{k}: #{v}"  if v.present? %>
<% end %>

<% if @subscription.person.present? %>
	The details we had on our system are
	<% @subscription.person.attributes.each do |k,v| %>
		<%= "    #{k}: #{v}" if v.present?  %>
	<% end %>
<% end %>
